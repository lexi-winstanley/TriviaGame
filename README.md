## Motivation 
To create a JavaScript trivia game that displays timed questions for a user to answer, keeps track of number correct/incorrect and displays that information once all questions have been answered. 

## Summary
This trivia game is about woodworking. On page load an instruction screen is displayed. Once the player clicks the "Start Game" button the first question appears. The player is given a certain amount of time in which to answer the question. After they answer or time runs out, the correct answer will be confirmed or shown and a new question will load. The timer will reset each time a new question appears. Once the player has gone through all the questions a screen will display the total correct/incorrect answers. Not answering in the allotted time counts as an incorrect answer.

## Details
Timeout functions and intervals are used to display the questions and a countdown of time to answer. Once the user answers a page is shown that reveals the correct answer. After a set amount of time the next question is shown and a new countdown begins. Once all the questions have been answered a summary screen is shown and the game is over.
